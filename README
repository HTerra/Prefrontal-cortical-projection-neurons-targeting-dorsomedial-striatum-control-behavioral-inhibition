This repository contains Matlab scripts used in: Terra, Bruinsma et al. (2020). Prefrontal cortical projection neurons targeting dorsomedial striatum control behavioral inhibition. Current Biology

These scripts were made for making and using the following Matlab structs and cell arrays, which store all information required for plotting.
1. All - This 'master' cell array contains most information about neurons (i.e. recording location, neuron number, shank, peak waveofrm channel, optogenetic identification etc.)
2. neuronIndex - This struct contains the indexes of different neuron types (i.e. all broad-spiking identified neurons etc.) that can be used to quickly sample a subset of neurons
3. parameters_OI - contains the criteria required for a neuron to be optogenetically identified
4. ITI_All and ITI_OI - These structs contain the information needed to make PETHs for non-identified neurons (_All) and identified neurons (_OI) in inhibitory control (variable delay) sessions
5. SD_All and SD_OI - Similar as ITI_ALL and ITI_OI but for attention (variable stimulus duration) sessions.

You also need the behavioral output files (MED PC, .mpc).
